# Sports-tracker

## Description
This app keeps users updated with real-time information on basketball and baseball games. This includes ongoing games, game results, and other statistics from the games.

- What was your motivation?
To create and app to allow us to track games of the sport that we are interested in and utilizes the knowledge we've acquired up to this point in the program.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
The intention of this project was to showcase the skills we have up to this point and for this project to become part of our professional portfolio. It can also be used as a reference to look back on and see the progress that has been made.

- What did you learn?
What was learned was a variety of different things. Starting out with setting up a collaboration environment where all members can see the progress made in the application & pending approvals of changes/improvements made to the application.
We learned how APIs and API keys work and how to implement them in functions such as Fetch and sport APIs. The CSS framework that was used was, Bulma. With that, thorough research needed to be conducted to understand the framework and how to implement it into our application. We also learned how to dynamically add content to our webpage using JavaScript.
